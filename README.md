## Basic Machine Learning algorithms

### Introduction
This repo includes all of my weekly practice excercises in Course MAT3533 - Machine Learning, covering some of the most basic and common ML algorithms (classification, clustering, neural network, etc.). Oftentimes, each algo is implemented (1) from scratch using maths formulas and (2) through existing scikit-learn libraries for comparison and better understanding of the original principles.

### Contents
The main algorithm covered each week are:
  - Week01: Naive Bayes (GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB)
  - Week02: Linear Regression
  - Week03: Logistic Regression
  - Week04: Multinomial Logistic Regression
  - Week05: PCA
  - Week06: Perceptron
  - Week07: ANN
  - Week08: CNN
  - Week09: Clutering (K-means, Gaussian Mixture Model)
  - Week10: SVM (soft/hard margin, kernel)
