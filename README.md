## Basic Machine Learning algorithms

### Introduction
This repo includes all of my **individual practice excercises** in **Course MAT3533 - Machine Learning**, covering some of the **most basic and common ML algorithms** (classification, clustering, neural network, etc.). Oftentimes, each algorithm is implemented (1) ***from scratch*** using calculated formulas and (2) through existing ***scikit-learn libraries*** for comparison and better understanding of the mathematical principles.

### Contents
The main algorithm covered each week are:
  - Week01: Naive Bayes (GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB)
  - Week02: Linear Regression
  - Week03: Logistic Regression
  - Week04: Multinomial Logistic Regression
  - Week05: PCA
  - Week06: Perceptron
  - Week07: ANN
  - Week08: CNN
  - Week09: Clutering (K-means, Gaussian Mixture Model)
  - Week10: SVM (soft/hard margin, kernel)
